# AI Assistant for Doctors - Master Plan

## App Overview
**Name:** AI Assistant for Doctors  
**Goal:** To assist independent doctors and clinics in diagnosing diseases from chest X-ray images using AI, with an intuitive web dashboard where they can upload, analyze, and download reports.

## Target Audience
- Independent doctors and small clinics without access to advanced diagnostic AI tools.
- Primarily those working with chest X-rays.

## Core Features & Functionality
- Secure Doctor Login with hospital-affiliated email.
- Drag-and-Drop Image Upload of chest X-rays (minimal compression).
- Real-Time Disease Predictions using the CheXAgent model.
- Downloadable PDF Reports of prediction results.
- Simple Dashboard UI focused solely on analysis â€” no complex extras.
- Real-Time Feedback Loop after image upload.

## High-Level Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS - Lightweight and fast, ideal for a simple GUI dashboard.
- **Backend:** Express.js - Manages image uploads, user auth, and AI model integration.
- **AI Model:** CheXAgent - Pre-trained for chest X-ray disease classification.
- **Storage:** Firebase Storage - Stores uploaded X-ray images (as base64 or files).
- **Authentication:** Custom + Email Validation - Validates users by checking @hospitalname.com emails.
- **Database:** Firestore (optional) - For storing prediction metadata or user history if needed in future.
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting or Vercel - Easy and free options for hosting the frontend/backend.

## Conceptual Data Model
- **User (Doctor):** ID, Name, Hospital Email, Login Timestamp.
- **X-ray Image Record:** Image URL, Upload Time, Predicted Conditions, Confidence Scores, Downloaded Report Flag.

## UI/UX Design Principles
- Clean, minimal dashboard.
- Upload panel front and center.
- Prediction results shown immediately below upload.
- Report download button easily accessible.
- Responsive design (usable on tablets or desktop).

## Security Considerations
- Email-based authentication (doctors only).
- Firebase Storage rules to restrict image access.
- HTTPS-only communication.
- Basic file validation for X-ray images (file size, type).
- No sensitive patient info stored.

## Development Phases
### Phase 1: Core Build
- Implement login system.
- Set up drag-and-drop upload to Firebase.
- Connect Express backend to CheXAgent.
- Display predictions on frontend.

### Phase 2: Report System
- Generate downloadable report (e.g., PDF or printable HTML).
- Include AI predictions + visual aids (if available).

### Phase 3: Polishing
- Improve UI/UX.
- Add minor enhancements (e.g., upload history, better loading states).

## Potential Challenges & Solutions
- **Model integration complexity:** Start with CheXAgent's sample scripts and adapt for Express-based API.
- **Prediction delays:** Ensure model is optimized and preloaded at server start.
- **File size or type errors:** Add frontend & backend validation before upload.
- **Doctor validation spoofing:** Use domain checks & manual review if needed.

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Support for other imaging types (CT, MRI).
- Patient profile and upload history.
- Multilingual interface.
- Telemedicine features.
- Integration with EHR systems.
